<p>Mob Psycho 100 is a Japanese web manga series written and illustrated by One. It was serialized on Shogakukan's Ura Sunday website from April 2012 
to December 2017. It has been also available online on Shogakukan's mobile app MangaONE since December 2014. Shogakukan compiled its chapters into 
sixteen tankōbon volumes. </p>

<p> As the subconscious manifestation of Mob's repressed psychic power, it views itself as Mob's truest existence, something which has been alluded to by other characters.
It only ever manifests itself in the physical world when Mob loses consciousness in a situation of extreme stress[3] or when Shigeo's physical body is destroyed, as seen 
during his fight with Mogami, whereupon it proceeds to either destroy the cause of the problem or carry out Mob's current desire. It explains that it does this for its own 
sake as it can do what it wants to do.[4] It lives to be itself, and does not like Mob because he views him as the person who has kept him locked away by never truly 
embracing his psychic powers and only using them on the rarest of occasions. Despite having the same general desires as Mob, such as his attraction to Takane Tsubomi and 
love for his brother, it does not trust anyone else or any of the people that Mob interacted with and made friendships with throughout his time in middle school.
