powers. Ritsu, still relishing in his powers, attempts to end his relationship with Mob, but is shocked to see Mob protecting him by apologizing 
on his behalf to the thugs, grovelling to them. Suddenly, an adult esper named Cadre Koyama intervenes and attempts to kidnap Ritsu after mistaking
 him for Mob. When Ritsu gets hurt by Koyama, Mob becomes enraged and goes 100%, overwhelming Koyama. Koyama uses a cursed spray on Mob to knock him

 a criminal organization of espers bent on world domination who have kidnapped other young adolescent espers to brainwash them and use them for their 
 nefarious plans. Dimple informs Mob and Teru that Koyama may have found out about the Kageyama Brothers from the Awakening Lab. The trio arrive at the

  hideout, called the Seventh Division. </p>

<p> As the subconscious manifestation of Mob's repressed psychic power, it views itself as Mob's truest existence, something which has been alluded to by other characters.
It only ever manifests itself in the physical world when Mob loses consciousness in a situation of extreme stress or when Shigeo's physical body is destroyed, as seen 
during his fight with Mogami, whereupon it proceeds to either destroy the cause of the problem or carry out Mob's current desire. It explains that it does this for its own 
sake as it can do what it wants to do. It lives to be itself, and does not like Mob because he views him as the person who has kept him locked away by never truly 
embracing his psychic powers and only using them on the rarest of occasions. Despite having the same general desires as Mob, such as his attraction to Takane Tsubomi and 
love for his brother, it does not trust anyone else or any of the people that Mob interacted with and made friendships with throughout his time in middle school.A 
self-proclaimed exorcist and fraud named Reigen Arataka attempts to exorcise an evil spirit, despite having only stumbled onto it by accident. Much to Reigen's 
shock, the spirit seems to only be annoyed by his ineffective attacks, which consist of throwing a handful of table salt at the spirit (meant to be purified salt). 
Reigen then unleashes his secret weapon: calling in an actual psychic (also referred to as an esper), Shigeo Kageyama, a.k.a. "Mob", to banish the spirit for him 
with his psychokinetic powers. Mob is an extremely powerful psychic, despite only being in middle school. Some time later, Reigen is contracted to get rid of evil 
spirits inhabiting a tunnel. Once again, Reigen manages to trick Mob into doing most of the work for him. One of the ghosts, the deceased leader of a biker gang, 
warns of an even more powerful monster located deeper in the tunnel, and begs Reigen and Mob to not fight it. However, Mob manages to take it down anyway. The 
spirits of the leader and his gang are finally at peace and move on to the afterlife.The "Telepathy Club" at Mob's school is in danger of disbanding after it drops 
below the minimum number of members. The group desperately tries to get other students to join their club, and drag Mob into the clubroom in an attempt to convince 
him to join. The Telepathy Club's leader, Tome Kurata, argues with Reigen over the phone as he wants Mob to focus on his job instead of the club. Later, Reigen takes 
Mob on a contract to exorcise a spirit at a private all-girls high school. Both he and Mob cross-dress to infiltrate the school, but Reigen is immediately stopped 
by security while Mob goes on to meet his clients alone. The clients, a pair of schoolgirls, lead him around the school until he finds the large ghost of a dead 
schoolboy observing basketball practice on campus. After defeating the ghost, it begs him to enjoy his youth before it disappears. The next day, the student 
ouncil at Mob's school threatens to turn the Telepathy Club's room over to the newly-formed Body Improvement Club as Mob is about to join. After having a flashback
 where Mob remembers his poor physical abilities, Mob decides to join the Body Improvement Club instead.

On December 2, 2015, Ura Sunday announced that Mob Psycho 100 would be adapted into an anime television series. The anime adaptation was produced by Bones and 
directed by Yuzuru Tachikawa. Hiroshi Seko wrote the scripts, Yoshimichi Kameda designed the characters, and Kenji Kawai composed the music. The series aired 
between July 12, 2016 and September 27, 2016, on Tokyo MX, later airing on ytv, BS Fuji and TV Asahi Channel 1. The opening theme song, "99", is performed by Mob 
Choir while the ending theme song, titled "Refrain Boy" (リフレインボーイ, Rifurein Bōi), is performed by All Off.The success of Mob Psycho 100s first season was to
 be expected in many ways. The mangas creator, simply referred to by the pseudonym, ONE, is known for having a brilliant mind for story telling and a firm grasp of
  comedic writing and direction. With his use of self-aware humour, he had already proven this through producing one of the biggest breakout hits in the world of 
  manga, and later anime, One Punch Man: an anime adaptation that pushed the boundaries in terms of animation, while also grounding and humanising its characters
   with a masterful control of tone. The story of Mob was told in the same manner and executed as effectively as his previous works adaptation, with the added 
   caveat of their goals being inversions of one another. Mob looked to be normal, to blend in, and live a life like those around him. With humour and hijinks, 
   this was as successful as would be expected when dealing with a temperamental power of this magnitude, the building percentage of psychic power increasing with 
   each episode, until it inevitably broke free like a psychically powered bull in the proverbial china shop. The series continues the story of middle-school boy, 
   Shigeo Kageyama, nicknamed Mob due to his forgettable character. While appearing rather subdued and boring, Mob has a rare gift and is actually an incredibly 
   powerful psychic, known in this world as an esper. He continuously keeps his emotions in check so as to not lose control of his abilities and hurt those around 
   him, resulting in him being rather withdrawn from his classmates. For guidance in controlling his psychic abilities and many other aspects of life he looks to
    his employer, Reigen Arataka, a self-proclaimed psychic who in reality is a con-man with no psychic powers to speak of. The pair are frequently getting into 
    trouble through encounters with evil spirits, other espers or the evil organisation Claw.
With this second season, the characters, the tone, and the supernatural machinations in the background are very familiar and follow the template 
established by the first season; however, something is changing, and it is Mob himself. This is where the second season develops from what we have 
come to expect into something quite unexpected.Mob Psycho 100 II starts immediately after the events of the previous season, with Mob stepping back into 
his everyday life at school. Mob returns with his growing group of friends, though having gained some experience through awkward school drama and psychic battles
 alike, Mob himself is beginning to change. His power is growing, but so is he as a character. Beginning early in the season, Mob becomes much more introspective
  and starts to really look at who he is, his weaknesses, and the sort of person he wishes to be, each episode presenting another situation for him to learn from.
